# Sign Language Detection with Action Recognition and LSTM Deep Neural Network

This is a Sign Language Detection Project 📽. What it does is detect hand-signs in realtime using OpenCV and TensorFlow LSTM Model. The current model is trained on detect "I Love You ♥", "Hello 👋", "Thank You🎇", "Volume Up 🔊" and "Volume Down 🔈" hand signs.
